	abstract = {Despite increasing financial pressures on higher education systems throughout the world, many governments remain resolutely opposed to the introduction of tuition fees, and some countries and states where tuition fees have been long established are now reconsidering free higher education. This paper examines the consequences of charging tuition fees on university quality, enrolments, and equity. To do so, we study the English higher education system which has, in just two decades, moved from a free college system to one in which tuition fees are among the highest in the world. Our findings suggest that England’s shift has resulted in increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. In contrast to other systems with high tuition fees, the English system is distinct in that its income-contingent loan system keeps university free at the point of entry, and provides students with comparatively generous assistance for living expenses. We conclude that tuition fees, at least in the English case supported their goals of increasing quality, quantity, and equity in higher education.},

Whereas a scattering of earlier studies have elicited point expectations of earnings unconditional on future schooling, we elicit subjective earnings distributions under alternative scenarios for future schooling. In this exploratory study, we find that respondents are willing and able to respond meaningfully to questions eliciting their earnings expectations in probabilistic form. The 110 respondents vary considerably in their earnings expectations but there is a common belief that the returns to a college education are positive and that earnings rise between ages 30 and 40. There is a common belief that one's own future earnings are rather uncertain. Moreover, respondents tend to overestimate the current degree of earnings inequality in American society.},

We estimate a rich model of college major choice using the panel of beliefs data. While expected earnings and perceived ability are a significant determinant of major choice, heterogeneous tastes are the dominant factor in the choice of major. Analyses that ignore the correlation in tastes with earnings expectations inflate the role of earnings in college major choices.

All of the conventional treatment parameters as well as the more economically motivated treatment effects can be generated from a baseline marginal treatment effect. All of the estimation methods used in the applied evaluation literature, such as matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity methods, selection and control function methods, make assumptions about the marginal treatment effect which we exposit. Models for multiple outcomes are developed. Empirical examples of the leading methods are presented. Methods are presented for bounding treatment effects in partially identified models, when the marginal treatment effect is known only over a limited support.

The framework recognizes uncertainty faced by agents and ex ante and ex post evaluations of programs. It also considers distributions of treatment effects. These features are absent from the statistical literature on causal inference. A prototypical model of agent choice and outcomes is used to illustrate the main ideas. We formally develop models for counterfactuals and causality that build on Cowles Commission econometrics. These models anticipate and extend the literature on causal inference in statistics. The distinction between fixing and conditioning that has recently entered the statistical literature was first developed by Cowles economists. Models of simultaneous causality were also developed by the Cowles group, as were notions of invariance to policy interventions. These basic notions are updated to nonlinear and nonparametric frameworks for policy evaluation more general than anything in the current statistical literature on “causal inference”. A formal discussion of identification is presented and applied to clearly formulated choice models used to evaluate social programs.},

Differences between institutions are conceptualised in terms of institutional habitus, and the article explores how the four different institutional habituses result in a range of experiences of fitting in and standing out in higher education.

	abstract = {In this paper we explore changes over time in higher education (HE) participation and attainment between people from richer and poorer family backgrounds during a time period when the UK higher education system expanded at a rapid rate. We use longitudinal data from three time periods to study temporal shifts in HE participation and attainment across parental income groups for children going to university in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The key finding is a highly policy relevant one, namely that HE expansion has not been equally distributed across people from richer and poorer backgrounds. Rather, it has disproportionately benefited children from relatively rich families. Despite the fact that many more children from higher income backgrounds participated in HE before the recent expansion of the system, the expansion acted to widen participation gaps between rich and poor children. This finding is robust to different measures of education participation and inequality. It also emerges from nonparametric estimations and from a more detailed econometric model allowing for the sequential nature of education choices with potentially different income associations at different stages of the education sequence.},

	abstract = {Summary. The paper makes use of newly linked administrative education data from England to understand better the determinants of participation in higher education (HE) among individuals from low socio-economic backgrounds. The data are unique in being able to follow the population of two cohorts of pupils in England—those who might have entered HE between 2004–2005 and 2006–2007—from age 11 to age 20 years. The findings suggest that, although large differences in HE participation rates and participation rates at high status universities by socio-economic background remain, these differences are substantially reduced once prior achievement is included. Moreover, these findings hold for both state and private school pupils. This result suggests that poor achievement in secondary schools is more important in explaining lower HE participation rates among pupils from low socio-economic backgrounds than barriers arising at the point of entry to HE. These findings are consistent with the need for earlier policy intervention to raise HE participation rates among pupils from low socio-economic backgrounds.},

A quantitative version of the model matches well estimates of enrollment elasticities, variation in need-based and merit-based institutional aid with, respectively, student income and ability, and aggregate characteristics of U.S. higher education including college attendance in public and private schools, tuition levels, and the provision of federal aid. Predictions about the provision of federal aid and the distribution of students across colleges by ability and income match the empirical counterparts well. We use the model to examine the consequences of federal and state aid policies. A one-third increase in the maximum federal aid increases college attendance by 6 percent of the initial college population, most of the increase being in state colleges and mainly of poor students. Elite private colleges reduce institutional aid and use the net funding gain to spend more on educational inputs and to substitute some highly able poor students for less able rich students. Reductions in federal or state aid result in substantially reduced attendance mainly by poor students. Reductions of support to state colleges induces private colleges to increase enrollments modestly and improve in quality as demand shifts toward them.},

career, and marriage market choices of young female lawyers. Our model accounts for several
important institutional features of the labor market for lawyers, including differences in the work
hours across occupational tracks and learning about the prospects of promotion to partner. Some
female students need to take on large amounts of student debt to finance their education and
hence start their careers with large amounts of negative wealth. The empirical findings suggest
that student debt has negative effects on marriage prospects, career prospects, and investments in
educational quality of female lawyers. The analysis also provides new insights into the design of
public policies that aim to increase public sector employment. We show that it is possible to
design conditional wage or debt service subsidy programs that significantly increase public sector
career choices at reasonable costs.},

GED graduates are more likely to take vocational and technical training while ordinary graduates are more likely to attend academic programs. GED recipients are much less likely to complete the post-secondary programs they begin. The GED exam does not measure the ability or motivation that predicts successful completion of post-secondary schooling and training programs. Participation in post-secondary nonacademic training is positively related to family resources. Thus both academic and non-academic training operate to reinforce initial family earnings inequalities.},

Such phenomena span macroeconomics, ﬁnance, labor economics, political economy, and beyond. People’s choices of what information to attend to, i.e., what optimal heuristic to use, are driven by current economic conditions and determine the form of mistakes that they make. Combining these behavioral insights together with optimizing approaches of classical economics yields a new generally applicable model. The implied behavior features numerous types of empirically supported departures from existing classical models, is potentially highly practical for answering policy questions, and motivates further empirical work. One distinction from most models in behavioral economics is that this model allows for studying the adaptation of agents’ behavioral biases due to changes in policy or economic conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the identification and estimation of an extension of Roy’s model (1951) of sectoral choice, which includes a non-pecuniary component in the selection equation and allows for uncertainty on potential earnings. We focus on the identification of the non-pecuniary component, which is key to disentangling the relative importance of monetary incentives versus preferences in the context of sorting across sectors. By making the most of the structure of the selection equation, we show that this component is point identified from the knowledge of the covariate effects on earnings, as soon as one covariate is continuous. Notably, and in contrast to most results on the identification of Roy models, this implies that identification can be achieved without any exclusion restriction nor large support condition on the covariates. As a by-product, bounds are obtained on the distribution of the ex ante monetary returns. We propose a three-stage semiparametric estimation procedure for this model, which yields root-n consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. Finally, we apply our results to the educational context, by providing new evidence from French data that non-pecuniary factors are a key determinant of higher education attendance decisions.},

This is a key issue for a forward looking individual; an issue that has been largely overlooked in the literature. We present a dynamic model of individuals’ educational investments that allows us to explore alternative modeling strategies for forecasting future wage distributions. The key innovation we propose is an approach to forecasting that relies only on the information that would be available at the actual time decisions are made, and which incorporates the role of parameter uncertainty into the decision making process. This model is then used to analyze the eﬀects from: (a) actual changes in conditional wage distributions over the years 1980 to 1994; (b) the use of alternative forecasting behaviors; and (c) altering the individual’s aversion to risk (or intertemporal substitution). We also examine several other eﬀects aﬀecting the individuals’ decision making in that environment. These issues are studied in a variety of simulations using the March Current Population Surveys. We ﬁnd that the forecasting method used by individuals has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on schooling choices and the predictions of the model, and we provide new insights into the role of risk aversion, rising tuition costs, liquidity constraints, state dependence, and individuals’ unobserved heterogeneity.},

This paper addresses this shortfall using tax and student loan administrative data to investigate the variation in earnings of English graduates by socio-economic background. We find that graduates from higher income families (with median income of around 77,000) have average earnings which are 20\% higher than those from lower income families (with median income of around £26,000). Once we condition on institution and subject choices, this premium roughly halves, to around 10\%. The premium grows with age and is larger for men, in particular for men at the most selective universities. We estimate the extent to which different institutions and subjects appear to deliver good earnings for relatively less well off students, highlighting the strong performance of medicine, economics, law, business, engineering, technology and computer science, as well as the prominent London-based universities.},

	abstract = {Since the early-1990s the UK experienced an unprecedented increase in university graduates. The proportion of people with a university degree by age 30 more than doubled from 16\% for born in 1965-69 to 33\% for those born ten years later. At the same time the age proﬁle of the graduate premium remained largely unchanged across cohorts. This paper ﬁrst establishes the facts using a detailed analysis of micro-data on wage and employment patterns over the last two decades, benchmarked against the US economy. We then show that the stability of the age proﬁle in the premium across different birth cohorts is unlikely to be explained by either composition changes or selection on unobservables. We also argue that it is inconsistent with skill-biased technical change affecting all advanced economies in the same way. We further rule out explanations based on factor price equalisation. Our resolution of the puzzle is a model in which increases in level of education induce ﬁrms to transit toward a decentralised technology in which decision-making is spread more widely through the workforce. We provide empirical support for this view.},

However, in the UK the use of administrative data on individuals’ earnings, and particularly graduates’ earnings, is novel. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of such data is important as they are set to be used extensively for research and to inform policy. Here we compare survey-based labour earnings data from the UK’s Labour Force Survey (LFS) with UK Government administrative sources of individual level earnings data, focusing separately on young (up to age 32 years) graduates and non-graduates. This type of administrative data set has few sample selection issues and is longitudinal and its large samples mean that the earnings of subpopulations can potentially be studied with low error. Overall we ﬁnd a similar share of individuals with zero earnings in the LFS and administrative data, but a considerably higher share (conditionally on working) earning below £8000 in the administrative data. The LFS has generally higher earnings right through the distribution, though above the median a large share of the differences can potentially be explained by employee pension contributions. We also ﬁnd considerably larger gender difference in the survey data. The ﬁndings hold for both graduates and non-graduates. These differences are substantively important and suggest different conclusions about the gender wage gap, the graduate earnings premium and the extent of earnings inequality.},

We conducted a survey of high-ability currently enrolled college students and elicited beliefs about how their choice of college major, and whether to complete their degree at all, would affect a wide array of future events, including future earnings, employment, marriage prospects, potential spousal characteristics, and fertility. We ﬁnd that students perceive large “returns" to human capital not only in their own future earnings, but also in a number of other dimensions (such as future labor supply and potential spouse’s earnings). And, we ﬁnd evidence of students sorting into majors based on these perceived ex ante returns. In a follow-up survey conducted six years after the initial data collection, we ﬁnd a close connection between the expectations and current realizations. Finally, we show that both the career and family expectations help explain human capital choices, particularly the stark gender difference.},

No random sampling of units is involved. In biological work, random sampling is frequently unavoidable, in which case the joint distribution p.y, x/ depends on the sampling scheme. Regression models can be used for the study of dependence provided that the conditional distribution p.yjx/ for random samples agrees with px.y/ as determined by the regression model for a ﬁxed sample having a non-random conﬁguration x. The paper develops a model that avoids the concept of a ﬁxed population of units, thereby forcing the sampling plan to be incorporated into the sampling distribution. For a quota sample having a predetermined covariate conﬁguration x, the sampling distribution agrees with the standard logistic regression model with correlated components. For most natural sampling plans such as sequential or simple random sampling, the conditional distribution p.yjx/ is not the same as the regression distribution unless px.y/ has independent components. In this sense, most natural sampling schemes involving binary random-effects models are biased.The implications of this formulation for subject-speciﬁc and population-averaged procedures are explored.},

	abstract = {Using detailed survey data collected by Céreq (the Defis survey), linked to French administrative data on wages (DADS), we first carry out reduced-form analysis in the shape of difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates of the impact of formal train- ing on wages and other outcomes. The estimated effects on wages are negligible, but we find small positive effects of training on the probability of gaining a perma- nent contract (CDI) and on becoming a full-time employee. These effects appear to be driven mainly by individuals who move firm. We then exploit a policy-relevant instrumental variable (IV)—whether the individual reports having received infor- mation on training from their firm. IV estimates of the same effects are larger in magnitude but are not statistically significant at even the 10\% level. We then in- troduce unobserved heterogeneity as latent types. Our novel identification strategy allows us to use a binary instrument to estimate the effects of multivalued treat- ment. We estimate our model on the Defis data via the EM algorithm, and calculate analogues of the reduced-form treatment effects, to enable comparison with DiD and IV approaches. Our flexible model and estimation approach allows us to produce wage distributions conditional on worker type and training status.},

This research explored whether critical thinking ability or intelligence was the better predictor of real life events. Community adults and college students (n = 244) completed a critical thinking assessment, an intelligence test, and an inventory of life events. Individuals with higher critical thinking scores and higher IQs reported fewer negative life events. Critical thinking more strongly predicted life events than intelligence and signiﬁcantly added to the variance explained by IQ. There is ample evidence that critical thinking can be taught, so there is hope that teaching critical thinking skills might prevent the occurrence of negative life events. We advocate for critical thinking instruction as a way to create a better future for everyone.},

Skills are determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later stages.},

	abstract = {This paper considers a prototypical prob- lem in the econometrics of selection bias: estimating the impact of unionism on wage differentials. The statistical structure of this problem is the same as that of many other self-selection problems in economics. The union wage differential question is of interest in its own right, and has been the subject of numerous papers evaluated in the landmark study of H. Gregg Lewis (1986).
I consider the following questions. 1) What are the parameters of economic interest? 2) Under what conditions can they be identi- fied? 3) How can alternative nonparametric procedures set forth in the literature aid in (1) Y=6Y1D+Yo(l-D) -( Xlfl) D + ( Xoo) (1- D) + DU,+(I-D)Uo. securing the parameters of interest? 4) What is the status of the evidence on appropriate methods for estimating union-nonunion wage differentials? The answer to the third ques- tion is particularly relevant in view of Lewis'pessimistic and influential summary of exist- ing studies that attempt to correct for self- selection bias. He complains about the wide variation in the estimates produced in dif- ferent studies. Such variability may be due to the imposition of false distributional as- sumptions-an issue that motivates the re- cent literature on nonparametric estimation.},

They predict and cause important life outcomes such as wages, health, and longevity. Skills develop over the life cycle and can be enhanced by education, parenting, and environmental influences to different degrees at different ages. Economic analysis clarifies psychological studies by establishing that personality is measured by performance on tasks which depends on incentives and multiple skills. Identification of any single skill therefore requires isolation of confounding factors, accounting for measurement error using rich data and application of appropriate statistical techniques. Skills can be inferred not only by questionnaires and experiments but also from observed behavior. Economists advance the analysis of human differences by providing anchored measures of economic preferences and studying their links to personality and cognitive skills. Connecting the research from the two disciplines promotes understanding of the number and nature of skills and preferences required to characterize essential differences.},

For this purpose, the observed data are assigned to unknown clusters using a maximum a posteriori operator.

Numerical experiments on simulated and real data of the resulting ICL criterion show that it performs well both for choosing a mixture model and a relevant number of clusters. In particular, ICL appears to be more robust than BIC to violation of some of the mixture model assumptions and it can select a number of dusters leading to a sensible partitioning of the data.},

During the first ten years in the labor market, a typical worker will hold seven jobs, about two thirds of his career total. The evolution of wages plays a key role in this transition to stable employment: wage gains at job changes account for at least a third of early-career wage growth, and the wage is the key determinant of job changing decisions among young workers. Job changing is a critical component of workers' movement toward the stable employment relations of mature careers. The wastefulness of this "try and try again" process of advancing to a better position is self-evident. The worker does not know in detail the nature of the job which he is obtaining nor does he know his own capacities. Nevertheless it is the principal method by which workers at the present time improve their condition on their own initiative [Slichter, 1919, p. 218].},

This paper examines the extent to which cognitive biases plague subjective data, and specifically addresses the questions of: (1) whether cognitive dissonance affects the reporting of beliefs; and (2) whether individuals exert sufficient mental effort when probed about their subjective beliefs. For this purpose, I collect a unique panel dataset of Northwestern University undergraduates which contains their subjective expectations about major-specific outcomes for their chosen major as well as for other alternatives in their choice set. I do not find evidence of cognitive biases systematically affecting the reporting of beliefs. By analyzing patterns of belief updating, I can rule out cognitive dissonance being of serious concern in the current setting. There does not seem to be any systematic (non-classical) measurement error in the reporting of beliefs: I do not find systematic patterns in mental recall of previous responses, or in the extent of rounding in the reported beliefs for the various majors. Comparison of subjective beliefs with objective measures suggests that students have well-formed expectations. Overall, the results paint a favorable picture for the use of subjective expectations data in choice models.},

By including human capital, a fresh perspective on economic growth across time and within specific subperiods is revealed, notably regarding the 1995–2000 and 2007–2009 periods. During the 1995–2000 period, the reduction in human capital investment significantly reduced apparent economic growth. In the 2007–2009 period, the increase in human capital investment tempered the negative impact of the Great Recession. Over the longer time period, first the post-World War baby boom and then the substantial increase in education led to higher economic growth than otherwise expected. As the pace of increase in education slowed and the workforce aged toward the end of the period, human capital induced growth was reduced.},

We propose using a Bayesian hierarchical latent class model to summarize and interpret observed heterogeneity in categorical expectations data. We show that the statistical model corresponds to an economic structural model of information acquisition, which guides interpretation and estimation of the model parameters. An algorithm based on stochastic optimization is proposed to estimate a model for repeated surveys when beliefs follow a dynamic structure and conjugate priors are not appropriate. Guidance on selecting the number of belief types is also provided. Two examples are considered. The first shows that there is information in the Michigan survey responses beyond the consumer sentiment index that is officially published. The second shows that belief types constructed from survey responses can be used in a subsequent analysis to estimate heterogeneous returns to education.},

	abstract = {A popular way to account for unobserved heterogeneity is to assume that the data are drawn from a finite mixture distribution. A barrier to using finite mixture models is that parameters that could previously be estimated in stages must now be estimated jointly: using mixture distributions destroys any additive separability of the log-likelihood function. We show, however, that an extension of the EM algorithm reintroduces additive separability, thus allowing one to estimate parameters sequentially during each maximization step. In establishing this result, we develop a broad class of estimators for mixture models. Returning to the likelihood problem, we show that, relative to full information maximum likelihood, our sequential estimator can generate large computational savings with little loss of efficiency.},

	abstract = {We estimate a structural dynamic Roy model of education, labor supply and earnings on the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of males taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and evaluate to what extent changes in education and labor supply decisions across cohorts have been explained by changes in i) the college premium, ii) the utility of attending higher education, iii) grade progression standards, and iv) the value of non-market time. We quantify the evolution of the relative and absolute qualities of both college graduates and college attendants (associates). We nd that it is impossible to rationalize changes in observed schooling decisions without appealing to a large increase in intrinsic taste for education, despite a doubling of the cost of college and its impact on debt-load. The population distribution of the college premium has shifted to the right, going from 50\% to 58\%, while the premium of actual college graduates has shifted to the left, going from 72\% to 54\%, thereby pointing toward a reduction of the relative quality of college graduates. The absolute quality (human capital) of college graduates has however remained stable. For college attendants (associates), both relative and absolute quality dropped. One implication of the relative attening of age earnings pro les is the removal of the negative e ect of late college graduation on early life-cycle wages. Our estimates indicate it moved from a 4\% penalty per year of delay to an insigni cant quantity by the early 2000's.},

But, as we argue in this paper, schooling generates many experiences and affects many dimensions of skill that, in turn, affect central aspects of individuals' lives. Schooling not only affects income, but also the degree to which one enjoys work, as well as one's likelihood of being unemployed. It leads individuals to make better decisions about health, marriage, and parenting. It also improves patience, making individuals more goal-oriented and less likely to engage in risky behavior. Schooling improves trust and social interaction, and may offer substantial consumption value to some students. We discuss various mechanisms to explain how these relationships may occur independent of wealth effects and present evidence that nonpecuniary returns to schooling are at least as large as pecuniary ones. Ironically, one explanation why some early school leavers miss out on these high returns is that they lack the very same decision-making skills that more schooling would help improve.},

Earnings of college graduates depend in important measure on the program of study and eventual occupation they choose. Students uninterested in or unable to complete a four-year college degree appear to benefit from completing a two-year degree. Prospective students may also face both financial constraints, which prohibit them from taking advantage of more education, and information problems and behavioral idiosyncrasies, such as reluctance to take on debt, which keep them from making optimal decisions about attending college. In their discussion of how student debt figures in the college investment, the authors note that some students borrow too little and, as a result, underinvest in their education. Carefully calculating the return on the college investment can help determine the "appropriate" amount of debt. Students are more likely to benefit from postsecondary education the more informed they are about the expenses associated with college and the potential options for financial aid, which can be extremely complex. To make the best college investment, Oreopoulos and Petronijevic stress, prospective students must give careful consideration to selecting the institution itself, the major to follow, and the eventual occupation to pursue. For any particular program at a particular school, anticipated future labor market earnings, the likelihood of completion, the costs, and the value of any student debt must all be factored into the assessment.},

A simple theoretical model that highlights the role of comparative advantage in the optimal schooling decision is presented and used to motivate an extended discussion of econometric issues, including the properties of ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimators. A review of studies that have used compulsory schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of schools, and similar features as instrumental variables for completed education, reveals that the resulting estimates of the return to schooling are typically as big or bigger than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation of this finding is that marginal returns to education among the low-education subgroups typically affected by supply-side innovations tend to be relatively high, reflecting their high marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability that limits their return to education.},

Adding a limited number of such questions to computerized surveys, whether self- or interviewer-administered, is neither expensive nor time-consuming, and in our experience respondents are quite willing and able to answer such questions.},

Coding can be performed from an instrumental or a representational perspective. In the first the coding is performed from the point of view of the investigator, it can be performed in a run of a computer program. In the second the point of view of the respondent is acknowledged. Now the computer can be used as a management tool, but the coding itself must be performed by a human coder. The choice for one of these methods depends on what the investigator is looking for and has consequences for the way how to proceed. When the representational way of coding is applied also questions about intercoder reliability must be posed. The codes to be used are decided upon before or during the coding process.},

Yet the almost exclusive use of this form did not arise because open-ended questions, its major competitor, proved to be weak indicators of public opinion. Instead, responses from open-ended questions proved more difficult and expensive to code and analyze than those from closed-ended questions. Although such practical concerns are important, the real task of survey researchers is to measure public opinion accurately. Using an experimental desing this article tests whether open-ended questions measure the important concerns of respondents-one of the long-claimed advantages of this format. The results, on balance, show that open-ended comments reflect such concerns, suggesting that pollsters may want to include more of these questions in their surveys of public opinion.},

	abstract = {A postal survey study of factors correlated with consumer debt investigated several psychological variables which have been suggested as causes or effects of debt. The survey was conducted with the help of a public utility company, and questionnaires were sent to three groups with different debt histories over the preceding two years: Non-Debtors (no debt to the company), Mild Debtors (late payment to the company), and Serious Debtors (sued for debt recovery by the company). Economic and demographic factors predicted debt category well, supporting previous results. Further variance between groups was accounted for by people's money management skills and facilities, by measures of their time horizons, and by aspects of their consumer behaviour. Non-debtors had more money management facilities (e.g. bank accounts) than debtors, and rated their abilities at money management more highly. Debtors had shorter time horizons than non-debtors. Debtors were more likely to buy cigarettes and Christmas presents for children than non-debtors. No group differences were found for attitudes to debt or locus of control. There were significant group differences for measures of economic socialization, social comparisons, use of credit, and other aspects of consumer behaviour, but these differences were not independently significant on multivariate analysis. Conclusions must be qualified because of low return rates, but the results suggest that a complex of psychological and behavioural variables affect debt and are affected by it. It is argued that these variables are linked to the psychology of poverty.},

We find that labor market prospects play a small role. Instead, nonpecuniary outcomes, such as the school's ideology, are the major determinants.

	abstract = {This Election Briefing Note compares Labour's proposed reforms to the system of higher
education (HE) finance in England and the alternative proposals outlined by the Conservative
Party in September 2004 and the Liberal Democrats in January and March 2005.
At their root, all of the parties' proposals aim to increase the level of funding per university student. But the ways in which this will be achieved are very different. This has implications for how well off students will be and how well off future graduates will be, and will also have implications for universities and the taxpayer. All of these issues are explored in this Note.
The structure of the Note is as follows: Section 2 sets out the key features of the three partiesҍ
HE funding policies; Section 3 describes how the numbers behind the different proposals add
up, setting out the implications for taxpayers, universities, students and graduates; Section 4
sets out what the figures mean for university funding on a per-student basis, some
distributional implications for universities and an international comparison; Section 5
provides an assessment of what the reforms would mean for the living standards of students
whilst at university, and what levels of debt students are likely to graduate with under
different funding systems; Section 6 gives an in-depth examination of the impact of different
HE funding policies on graduates across the entire distribution of likely future graduate
earnings paths; and Section 7 concludes.},

We use data on students' enrollment decisions and application decisions—i.e., the sets of colleges to which they applied—to identify the distribution of students' preferences. We use our estimates to quantify differences in a student's expected value upon college application that result from the uneven spatial distribution of colleges. Asfwith other aspects of economic opportunity, we ˝nd that place matters: students with otherwise identical characteristics can have very different expected values depending on where they live. The importance of location reflects differences across states as well as differences across counties within a state. For students with low parental incomes and low SAT scores, over 70\% of the variation is within-state across counties, while for students with high parental incomes and high SAT scores, 66\% of the variation is across states.},

We show that taking into account the additional information about higher moments of individual belief distributions contained in probabilistic expectations data is important for detecting types of violations of Rational Expectations that are not detectable by existing mean-based tests. Beliefs about future income are found to become more accurate as students progress through school and then enter the post-college period. Tests of Rational Expectations almost always reject for the in-school period, but the evidence against Rational Expectations is much weaker in the post-college period.},

The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorisation, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for "wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

I shed new light on this key issue by comparing and quantifying the roles of earnings expectations and non-pecuniary factors in educational decisions and career choices. I also investigate changes in these factors over time, and their implications for social mobility. I specify a model of educational choice, in which I explicitly include expectations about earnings and other, chieﬂy non-pecuniary, factors. I exploit panel survey data on students’ expectations about key outcomes both at, and after, university, alongside data on their realised outcomes to estimate the model. I ﬁnd that income maximisation, despite its prevalent role in the literature, is only a small part of the story: other factors are four times as important as earnings in determining whether someone goes to university. Non-pecuniary factors also drive both the SES-gap in educational attainment, and the huge growth in degree attainment between the 1980s and 2010s. I then specify an extended model allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in students’ earnings expectations. I use a novel technique to estimate the model via the EM-algorithm. Estimation of this updated model is currently ongoing.},

	abstract = {This paper formulates a simple regenerative optimal stopping model of bus engine replacement to describe the behavior of Harold Zurcher, superintendent of maintenance at the Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan Bus Company. The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programming problem that formalizes the trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a "bottom-up" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.},

Taking advantage of the longitudinal nature of the expectations data, we find that roughly two-thirds of the income uncertainty present at the time of entrance remains at the end of college. Taking advantage of a variety of additional survey questions, we provide evidence about how the resolution of income uncertainty is influenced by factors such as college GPA and college major, and also examine why much income uncertainty remains unresolved at the end of college.

	title = {The role of attitudes and behaviours in explaining socio- economic differences in attainment at age 16},
	abstract = {It is well known that children growing up in poor families leave school with considerably lower qualifications than children from better off backgrounds. Using a simple decomposition analysis, we show that around two fifths of the socio-economic gap in attainment at age 16 can be accounted for by attainment at age 11, suggesting that circumstances and investments made considerably earlier in the child’s life explain a sizable proportion of the gap in test scores between young people from rich and poor families. However, we also find that differences in the attitudes and behaviours of young people and their parents during the teenage years play a key role in explaining the richpoor gap in GCSE1 attainment: together, they explain a further quarter of the gap at age 16, and two fifths of the small increase in this gap between ages 11 and 16. On this basis, our results suggest that while the notion that “skills beget skills” implies that the most effective policies in terms of raising the attainment of young people from poor families are likely to be those enacted before children reach secondary school, policies that aim to reduce differences in attitudes and behaviours between the poorest children and those from better-off backgrounds during the teenage years may also make a significant contribution towards lowering the gap in achievement between young people from the richest and poorest families at age 16.},
