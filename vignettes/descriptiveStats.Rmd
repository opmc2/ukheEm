# Next Steps (LSYPE1)

The main data source for this project is the longitudinal cohort study Next Steps, previously the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England 1 (LSYPE1).

## Descriptive statistics: full vs subsample

I select my subsample based on some key questions that were only asked to some of the students. 
These questions relate to the advantages and disadvantages of attending university, and were only asked to students who had at least 5 GCSEs at grade A*-C or passes at intermediate GNVQ. 
This does not seem to be an official "entry standard" to university, and it is not entirely clear to me why this selection was made for this question. 

```{r desc stats lsype1}

wageQs <- dtLsype[inSubSample == T, quantile(wage25, probs = c(0, .99), na.rm = T)]
